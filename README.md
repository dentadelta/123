## Life is an RPG Game

Life is an RPG game, and no matter how strong your character becomes, you will always face new challenges. The higher your level, the more difficult those challenges will be. You can work hard to overcome them, or you can try to cheat your way through. If money is your primary goal, then that is fair enough. But if money is not the goal, then cheating is just another way to shortcut the process in order to face bigger challenges and solve more impactful issues from the bottom of a good heart, trying to change the world.

We often think that cheating is like taking a shortcut to reach a destination, but if the destination is not fixed, then it is not actually a shortcut. It is just a path to reach a lifelong destination. And asking for help is admitting that you need assistance to reach your goal. This shows that you are willing to put in the work required to achieve success. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. It takes courage to admit that you need assistance and it shows that you are committed to reaching your goal.

Life is a very long journey and it is in fact a continuation over many generations that one person cannot do alone. We can only travel as far as we can carrying the torch and then pass it on to the next generation. Holding that torch is a life duty that one wishes to take on. And holding that torch requiring a person to be fit both physically and mentally, so that they do not do harm to themself, and most importantly, to others.
