I'm still working on my parallel_transformer notebook. All most finish coding the encoder part. I think you can only get the most out of transformer if you knnow how to code it from the scratch so that you can ultise multiple GPUs. 

You cannot run my notebook on Google Colab because you dont have multiple GPUs
