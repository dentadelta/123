#WIP

remaining:
* touch up
* extra
* bug free codes (too much effort, 80/20 rules, code probably going to break for unrealised reasons, but doesnt take long to fix)
* send email to receipients
* make a nice database instead of excel (if needed)
* no one size fit all solution (just need to create very basic superclass app, then subclass to specific type of contract)

Who's need $ Union. All codes are mine.
